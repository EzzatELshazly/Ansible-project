# Ansible-project
Welcome to the Ansible Project! This project is a comprehensive guide to implementing and harnessing the power of Ansible, an open-source automation platform. These hands-on labs cover a range of topics, from web server configuration to securing sensitive information using Ansible Vault.

Ansible Playbooks for Web Server Configuration using Ansible Vault
Overview
I've enhanced my expertise in Ansible by creating playbooksâ€”configurations that specify automation tasks. The primary focus is on configuring Nginx web servers, ensuring a consistent setup across various systems. Through deploying a sample website and implementing security measures, this project offers practical experience in automating web server configurations with Ansible.

Security with Ansible Vault
Additionally, the project explores Ansible Vault, a feature ensuring secure storage and encryption for sensitive data in playbooks. The demonstration involves encrypting critical information, such as database passwords, showcasing how to bolster security and safeguard confidential data during automation. Seamlessly integrating encrypted data into an Ansible playbook allows for the automation of tasks while maintaining the confidentiality of sensitive information.

Getting Started
Follow these steps to get started with the Ansible Project:

Install Ansible Package:
$ yum install ansible
Create Inventory:
Create an inventory containing the list of managed hosts/machines.

Run Ansible Playbook:
Execute the Ansible playbook for web server configuration.

$ ansible-playbook web_server_playbook
Ansible Vault: Encrypt Sensitive Data:
Create an Ansible Vault to encrypt sensitive data, such as a database password.

$ ansible-vault encrypt_string --vault-id vault.txt 'string-to-encrypt' --name 'variable_name'
Run Ansible Playbook with Encrypted Variables:
Run a playbook containing encrypted variables, prompting the user to enter the vault password interactively.

$ ansible-playbook --ask-vault-pass vault.yml

Conclusion
This project has provided practical experience in utilizing Ansible as an automation tool for managing and configuring systems. Gain knowledge in automating configurations and utilizing Ansible Vault for enhanced security. Feel free to explore, experiment, and adapt these practices to suit your specific use cases. Happy automating!
